\ This very short Forth code allows to transfer a very long FORTH program from the 
\ editor on PC to a file in the ESP32 card:
\   - compile with ESP32forth, the FORTH code, here the words noType and xEdit
\   - open on your PC the program to be transferred in a file on the ESP32 board
\   - add at the top of the program the line allowing this fast transfer:
\      xEdit /spiffs/myFile
\   - replace "myFile" with the name of the file to be created on the ESP32 board, 
\     example infix.txt if you load the code from infix.txt
\   - copy all the code of your program,
\   - pass in the terminal connected to ESP32forth
\   - copy your code
\ If all goes well, nothing should appear on the terminal screen. Wait a few seconds. 
\ Then type:
\   - CTRL-X and followed by pressing "Y"
\ You should have control again.
\ Check for the presence of your new file:
\     ls /spiffs/
\ You can now compile the contents of your new file with include


: noType 
    2drop ;

visual
: xEdit
    ['] noType is type
    edit
    ['] default-type is type
  ;

\ usage:
\ xEdit /spiffs/myFile      \ uncomment this line

\ put here the complete code you will load in '/spiffs/myFile'
